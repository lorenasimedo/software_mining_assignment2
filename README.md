## Implemented anti-patterns:

## How to run the anti-patterns analysis

Build and run the java file **ca.concordia.soen.Application** passing the absolute path of the project that you want to analyse as an argument.
A json file containing all the generated data will be created in the output folder. It will have the same name as the last folder of the argument you passed (which is supposed to be the project name)
